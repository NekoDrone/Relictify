# Relictify

Relictify is a relics calculator and build simulator for Honkai: Star Rail

The project is built in [Blazor](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor) for [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) written in C# as a Single-Page Application.

## Project Status

The project is mostly complete on the backend, save for a few minor changes that may arise on the frontend.

As of January 2024, the frontend remains a WIP.

## Planned Features

- [WIP] A near-identical clone of the in-game menus when entering the Characters screen ('C' key on PC).
- [WIP] Relics generator to test random relics at a similar drop rate to the actual game.
- [WIP] Relics crafter to test specific combinations of relics to see optimal builds.
- A damage calculator based on stats, specific character trace levels, and buff percentages.
- Team builder based on the above damage-calculator to help with optimal team combinations.

Additional features are welcome to be requested in the issues tab.

Relictify is NOT meant to simulate action cycles and optimal play for MoC/FH. For such a tool, please see [srsim](https://github.com/simimpact/srsim).
